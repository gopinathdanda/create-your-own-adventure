You sip your cappuccino but it has gone cold again. You don't like it cold. You set it aside and start fiddling with your pen, slowly tapping your blank notebook page with it. Writer's block is the worst that can happen to you at the moment. Or at least that is what you think.

You place your pen down and lean back on your chair, looking up at the coffeehouse ceiling, hoping desperately for some inspiration. The ceiling is too boring.
