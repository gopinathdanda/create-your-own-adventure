# Create Your Own Adventure

Inspired by create you own adventure books, this is a personal project of mine - a novel. Let's see how far I can write while making sense. :)

Concept is similar to what is done on Udacity - Git and Github course: using Markdown links. For example:

<pre>Click [here](http://www.github.com) to go to Github website</pre>

where square brackets is text and round brackets is the link.
